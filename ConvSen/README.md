# ConvSen: Convolution Neural Network For Sentence Classification

A simple C++ implementation of CNN_sentence(https://github.com/yoonkim/CNN_sentence).

## Introduction

Thanks to Yoon Kim, we have a convolution neural network approach to solve NLP problems! This demo is almost same with the architecture of the paper in reference, but without some tricks like dropout. It is a brilliant model and I hope you would love it. I used 4 hours in coding before releasing this code. So if you find bugs in my code, ask me to repair it please.

The input data is movie reviews. You can get data at http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/ .

Maybe you need a C++14 compiler to build the program.
